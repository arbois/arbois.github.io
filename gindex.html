<p>“One of the best books to appear in the last several decades about how to design organizations for continual innovation in high-pressure environments”
Jerry Neumann, founder of Neu Venture Capital</p>
<p><img src="UM_main3D.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><a name=“top”></a>The Uncertainty Mindset opens up the black box of elite culinary R&amp;D to provide essential insights about designing organizations to be innovative and adaptable in uncertain environments. Drawing on years of unprecedented access to the best and most influential culinary R&amp;D teams in the world, it reveals how they exemplify the uncertainty mindset. Such a mindset intentionally incorporates uncertainty into organization design, rather than simply trying to reduce risk. It changes how organizations hire, set goals, and motivate team members and leads organizations to work in highly unconventional ways. A revelatory look at the R&amp;D kitchen, The Uncertainty Mindset upends conventional wisdom about how to organize for innovation and offers practical insights for businesses trying to become innovative and adaptable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>”I expected this book to be about food and its future in today&#39;s world. It was more about management and creating a modern, resourceful, restaurant kitchen that will succeed in today&#39;s world. If you are going to run to are running [sic] a commercial kitchen this is the book for you - if you are interested in the future of food, it is not. As a librarian, if I do not learn something new or get engaged in the book, I am admitting thatI [sic] did not truly read/finish the book (I skimmed through it) as there are too many good ones out there to read and review.&quot; — Janet; Goodreads librarian.</p>
