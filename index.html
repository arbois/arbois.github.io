<p><a name="top"></a>The Uncertainty Mindset opens up the black box of elite culinary R&amp;D to provide essential insights about designing organizations to be innovative and adaptable in uncertain environments. Drawing on years of unprecedented access to the best and most influential culinary R&amp;D teams in the world, it reveals how they exemplify the uncertainty mindset. Such a mindset intentionally incorporates uncertainty into organization design, rather than simply trying to reduce risk. It changes how organizations hire, set goals, and motivate team members and leads organizations to work in highly unconventional ways. A revelatory look at the R&amp;D kitchen, The Uncertainty Mindset upends conventional wisdom about how to organize for innovation and offers practical insights for businesses trying to become innovative and adaptable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="review">“Vaughn Tan spent long periods observing of some of the world’s most famous chefs at work in their prize-winning restaurants and tells his readers what they do and how they do it. A real contribution to our understanding of how experts combine artistic creation and business success.”</p>
<p class="rattrib">Howard S. Becker; author of <em>Art Worlds</em>.</p>

<p class="review">“<em>The Uncertainty Mindset</em> takes a close look at the secret inner workings of some of the most innovative food R&amp;D teams worldwide. It shows organizations in other industries how to redesign themselves to become more resilient, innovative, and adaptable—by simply changing how they think about the future.”</p>
<p class="rattrib">Amy C. Edmondson; Harvard Business School; author of <em>The Fearless Organization</em>.</p>

<p class="review">“Vaughn Tan has written a fascinating, well-researched account of how some of the world’s top chefs and their teams approach culinary innovation. This book is full of valuable insights for forward-thinking, innovation-minded organizations and teams in any sector.”</p>
<p class="rattrib">Nathan Myhrvold, coauthor of <em>Modernist Bread, Modernist Cuisine</em>, and <em>Modernist Cuisine at Home</em>, author of <em>The Photography of Modernist Cuisine</em>.</p>

<p class="review">“This is one of the best books to appear in the last several decades about how to design organizations for continual innovation in high-pressure environments. It offers explanations for why some companies work and others don’t, and made me embrace a new, more subtle way of thinking about hiring, managing, and trusting innovators in leading-edge technology companies.”</p>
<p class="rattrib">Jerry Neumann; founder of Neu Venture Capital.</p>

<p class="review">“Chefs are responsible for some of today’s most novel innovations. Vaughn Tan goes behind the scenes to show how R&amp;D is organized inside the world’s most famous kitchens, uncovering surprising lessons that have wide application. This is a provocative contribution to studies of culture and R&amp;D.”</p>
<p class="rattrib">Walter W. Powell; Stanford University.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="review">“I expected this book to be about food and its future in today&#39;s world. It was more about management and creating a modern, resourceful, restaurant kitchen that will succeed in today&#39;s world. If you are going to run to are running [sic] a commercial kitchen this is the book for you - if you are interested in the future of food, it is not. As a librarian, if I do not learn something new or get engaged in the book, I am admitting thatI [sic] did not truly read/finish the book (I skimmed through it) as there are too many good ones out there to read and review.”</p>
